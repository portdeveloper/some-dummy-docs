# Streamline Your Documentation Workflow with AI

Are you tired of manually copying and formatting documentation content when working with AI assistants? The **Copy Page Button Plugin** for Docusaurus is here to revolutionize your workflow!

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

When working with AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude, documentation teams often need to:

- Copy page content for AI analysis
- Extract specific sections for review
- Share formatted content with team members
- Convert documentation to different formats

The manual process is tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex formatting, code blocks, and admonitions.

## The Solution

Our plugin adds a smart "Copy Page" button to every documentation page that:

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligently Extracts Content

The plugin doesn't just copy raw HTML. It:
- Removes navigation and UI elements
- Preserves important formatting
- Converts admonitions to readable text
- Maintains code block syntax highlighting information

### ðŸ¤– Integrates with AI Tools

Built-in integration means you can:
- Open content directly in ChatGPT
- Launch Claude with pre-formatted documentation
- Skip the copy-paste dance entirely

### âš¡ Works Out of the Box

Zero configuration required:
```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["docusaurus-plugin-copy-page-button"],
};
```

That's it! The button automatically appears in your table of contents sidebar.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Documentation Review

### Knowledge Base Creation
